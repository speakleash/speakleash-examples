"""
This module provides functionalities to create necessary directories and save documents 
of specified quality from the speakleash dataset to a specified folder.

Use `get_data(txt_folder_name)` function for creating directories and 
`save_quality_docs(txt_folder_name, quality)` for saving documents of a given quality.

Example usage:

1. In the `save_quality_docs` function, specify the name of the dataset to be downloaded 
   by setting the `quality` parameter.
2. Set the `limit` variable in the `save_quality_docs` function to determine how many documents you want to retrieve.
3. Import the module and use the provided functions in your own Python script.
4. Run this script directly from the command line.
5. If not present, a folder named "datasets" will be created in the script's directory to store the downloaded dataset.
6. If not present, another folder named "datasets_high_quality_txt" will be created to store high-quality text files.

This usage information covers the main aspects of the script, including the modification of key parameters, 
importing and using the module's functions, directly running the script, 
and the output resulting from running the script.
